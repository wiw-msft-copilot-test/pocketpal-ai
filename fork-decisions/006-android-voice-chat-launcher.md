# 006: Launch a fresh hands-free chat from Android

**Status:** Accepted

## Context

Hands-free conversation is an intentional fork feature under
[FD-003](001-sync-upstream-6cf3944.md#fd-003-hands-free-conversation-supersedes-one-shot-dictation),
and explicit cold-start model and Pal choices are preserved by
[003](003-startup-selection-restoration.md). Android users also need a direct
launcher entry that can begin a new hands-free conversation without turning
ordinary app launches into voice sessions or changing those remembered
choices.

The launcher is a private-build fallback for opening PocketPal by name. It is
not a Google Play App Action, an Android Auto integration, or permission to
bypass Android's restrictions on app launches while driving.

**Fork history:** `68619e1`, `e1595223`

## Decision

Preserve the separate Android **PocketPal Voice Chat** activity alias. Keep the
alias disabled until the app has a loaded model engine and is not loading model
context, so Android does not advertise a launcher that cannot begin a
conversation.

Normalize both cold and warm alias launches to the internal
`pocketpal://assistant/new-chat` route. An alias that was enabled before process
death can deliver a cold-start request before JavaScript has restored the
remembered selection or model engine. Keep that request transiently pending
while startup selection restoration and model context loading are in progress.
After restoration succeeds, reset the active session, navigate to a fresh chat
with the restored Pal and model, and start hands-free conversation when chat
input readiness permits it. If an installation has no explicit startup model
preference, restoration first adopts an available last-used model as described
by [007](007-last-used-model-restoration.md).
Resetting the session or handling the request must not rewrite the remembered
Pal or explicit `No Pal` preference.

Treat every launch as a bounded, single-use request:

- wait only while startup restoration or model context loading is actively
  unresolved, and do not reset the current chat during that wait;
- after restoration settles, reject the request before resetting the chat when
  no usable model engine is ready or the selected Pal requires video, and
  explain how to select a compatible Pal and loaded model before retrying;
- reject the request when generation is active or stopping, including if that
  state begins while restoration is pending;
- do not leave rejected requests queued to activate later;
- consume the request after conversation starts, if conversation is already
  active, or when readiness is lost;
- clear it when the app backgrounds, the chat input unmounts, or the user
  manually controls conversation mode; and
- use request identity so stale cleanup cannot consume a newer launch.

Clear draft text and selected images before automatic listening begins. A
launcher request must not interrupt an active generation or a conversation the
user started manually.

## Affected paths

- `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`
- `android/app/src/main/java/com/pocketpalai/MainActivity.kt`
- `android/app/src/main/java/com/pocketpalai/MainApplication.kt`
- `android/app/src/main/java/com/pocketpalai/VoiceChatLauncherModule.kt`
- `android/app/src/main/java/com/pocketpalai/VoiceChatLauncherPackage.kt`
- `src/specs/NativeVoiceChatLauncher.ts`
- `src/services/voiceChatLauncher.ts`
- `src/hooks/useDeepLinking.ts`
- `src/store/DeepLinkStore.ts`
- `src/components/ChatInput/ChatInput.tsx`
- Android manifest, deep-link, store, and ChatInput dictation tests
- English localization and getting-started documentation

## Rejected alternatives

- Enabling the alias permanently would advertise voice chat before a model can
  serve it. Waiting is limited to a launcher request that already arrived from
  an alias enabled before process death and remains in the active foreground.
- Starting conversation directly in native Android code would bypass startup
  restoration, Pal capabilities, generation state, React navigation, and the
  existing conversation guards.
- Persisting a pending request across backgrounding or navigation changes
  would allow stale user intent to start the microphone later.
- Reusing the current session would mix an explicit new voice interaction with
  prior conversation state.
- Treating the launcher as Android Auto or Assistant platform integration would
  promise capabilities this private, sideloaded application does not have.

## Preservation checks

Run the focused deep-link hook, deep-link store, ChatInput dictation, and
Android manifest contract tests. Cover cold and warm intent normalization,
dynamic alias enablement, new-session routing, preservation of remembered
selections, pending behavior during startup restoration and model loading,
actionable restoration-failure handling, active-generation rejection, video
Pal rejection, single-use request identity, manual-control ownership,
background and unmount cleanup, and draft or image clearing.

An Android build and emulator launch can establish manifest registration,
native-module wiring, and basic routing. They do not establish Google Assistant
launch permission, Android Auto availability, physical-device microphone
behavior, or safe use while driving.

## Superseded when

A later approved Android entry-point or platform integration provides an
equivalent fresh hands-free launch while preserving explicit startup choices,
eligibility checks, lifecycle cancellation, single-use request ownership, and
the existing on-device conversation safeguards.
