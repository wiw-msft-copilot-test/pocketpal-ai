# Getting Started

Note: Part of this guide is outdated. It will be updated soon.

## Installation

**iPhone** users can grab it here: [PocketPal AI on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pocketpal-ai/id6502579498)

**Android** users can get it from here: [PocketPal AI on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pocketpalai)

Note: This is a personal project, so I am working on it in my spare time. It might have bugs and issues, and obviously, I have not tested it on all devices. If you encounter any issues, open an issue, or even better, contribute to the project!

### Available Models

PocketPal AI comes pre-configured with some popular SLMs:

- Danube 2 and 3
- Phi
- Gemma 2
- Qwen

Modells need to be downloaded before use. You can download and use these models directly from the app and load any other GGUF models you like!

## Using PocketPal AI

### Downloading a Model

- Tap the burger menu
- Navigate to the “Models” page
- Choose your desired model and hit download

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
    <img src="../assets/add_model_1.webp" alt="Navigate to Models Page" style="width: 33%;">
    <img src="../assets/add_model_2.webp" alt="Download a Model" style="width: 33%;">
    <img src="../assets/add_model_3.webp" alt="Load a Model" style="width: 33%;">
</div>

### Loading a Model

After downloading, tap _Load_ to bring the model into memory. Now you’re ready to chat!

### Using Remote API Protocols

Remote servers can select **Auto**, **Chat Completions**, or **Responses** as
their API protocol. An individual remote model can inherit that setting or
override it with Chat Completions or Responses. Set the server default while
adding or managing a server and use the model settings for an override.
PocketPal resolves the effective protocol in this order:

1. model override;
2. server override;
3. endpoint support advertised by the model catalog; then
4. compatibility default: Chat Completions.

A catalog entry can be incomplete or inaccurate. PocketPal warns when an
override contradicts advertised support, and listing a model does not prove
that your credential is entitled to run it.

The Responses transport supports PocketPal text streaming, image-to-input
conversion, reasoning summaries, structured output, cancellation, usage, and
completed, incomplete, refusal, and failure outcomes. Local function talents
can execute in the agent loop and their outcomes are replayed to the provider.
Chats and the validated replay data needed to continue them are stored locally,
so completed conversations survive an app restart.

PocketPal sends Responses requests with `store: false`; it does not ask the
provider to retain a conversation. Instead, it explicitly replays local
history. A versioned, opaque provider-state block may be retained in local
messages and JSON chat backups when needed for faithful continuation. Copy and
Markdown export include visible text only, not that state. PocketPal will not
reuse opaque state after the provider server, model, or protocol changes.

Hosted OpenAI tools, background responses, WebSocket mode, and the Conversations
API are outside this integration's scope.

### Generation parameter defaults

Each optional generation setting has an explicit mode in the generation
settings sheets:

- **Use provider/native default** does not send that parameter.
- **Use custom value** sends the retained value.
- **Inherit** follows the parent preset where the setting is inherited.

Switching to the provider default keeps the custom value so it can be restored
later. A valid `0`, `false`, or backend-specific sentinel remains a real custom
value; it is not treated as omission. Omitting a parameter also does not disable
the corresponding algorithm—the active provider or local runtime chooses its
default. Required request fields, tools, schemas, routing, and safety controls
are not optional.

The same controls apply to remote and on-device generation settings. Thinking
has separate **backend default**, **On**, and **Off** intent; reasoning effort
can likewise inherit, use the backend default, or send an explicit supported
level. A provider may support only some optional parameters. For example, the
verified GitHub Copilot Responses model rejected `temperature` and `top_p`; set
those fields to **Use provider/native default** rather than changing their
saved custom values.

### Responses diagnostics

For troubleshooting a Responses provider, open **Settings → Diagnostics** and
turn on **Responses protocol logging**. The setting is memory-only and returns
to off after an app restart. It logs only bounded structural metadata such as
event types, indices, item types, status, and request parameter presence. It
does not log API keys, headers, URLs, prompts, generated text, tool payloads,
images, or reasoning content. Disable it when finished; existing Android
`logcat` lines are not retroactively erased.

### Using a GitHub Copilot Remote Model

PocketPal can connect to GitHub Copilot through either supported remote
protocol:

1. Open **Models**, tap **+**, then select **Add Remote Model**.
2. Set **Server Type** to **GitHub Copilot** before connecting.
3. Enter `https://api.githubcopilot.com` as the server URL. Do not append
   `/v1`; PocketPal uses unversioned `/models`, `/responses`, and
   `/chat/completions` for this server type. Other server types retain their
   `/v1/models`, `/v1/responses`, and `/v1/chat/completions` routes.
4. Enter a supported GitHub credential, select an available model, and add it.

GitHub documents fine-grained personal access tokens with the **Copilot
Requests** permission for Copilot CLI authentication. PocketPal stores the
credential in the platform Keychain/Keystore, but it does not implement GitHub
sign-in or refresh the credential. Your account must have the required Copilot
access and comply with any organization policy.

This option sends a pinned, test-suffixed Copilot CLI-derived identification
profile. GitHub may reject the custom `copilot-developer-cli-test` integration
ID, and PocketPal will not retry with the original identity. A model appearing
in `/models` does not prove entitlement or successful inference.

The Copilot integration was verified with deterministic local fixtures, not
live Copilot inference, because no explicit GitHub credential was supplied.
Fixture behavior validates PocketPal's transport and UI; it is not a GitHub API
contract.

To change the URL, credential, or server type later, open **Models**, tap **+**,
then **Manage Servers**. Re-select the remote model after editing its server so
the active chat uses the new configuration. Messages sent to any remote server
leave your device.

### Tips

On iOS devices, Apple’s GPU API (Metal) is activated by default. If you experience any hiccups, try deactivating it.

#### iOS Metal

#### Auto Offload/Load

To keep the device running smoothly, PocketPal AI can automatically manage memory usage:

- Enable “Auto Offload/Load” on the model page (by default it is)
- The app will offload the model when in the background
- It’ll reload when you return (give it a few seconds for larger models)

#### Advanced Settings

Click the chevron icon to access advanced LLM settings like:

- Temperature
- BOS token
- Chat template options
- etc.

</div>

### Finally, Let’s Chat!

Once your model is loaded, head to the “Chat” page and start conversing with the loaded model!

The generation performance metric is also displayed. If interested, watch the chat bubble for real-time performance metrics: Tokens per second and Milliseconds per token.

</div>

### Copying Text

Important Note: As of now, I haven’t found an easy way to select and copy text from the generated responses while preserving the text formatting, particularly Markdown support.

In the meantime, here are the current options for copying text:

- Paragraph-level copying: Long-press on a specific paragraph to copy its content.
- Full response copying: Use the copy icon at the bottom of the text bubble to copy the entire AI-generated response.

I know these options might not be ideal, and this is one of my frustrations with using other apps. The difficulty of copying portions of text used to be a particularly annoying aspect of chat apps like ChatGPT and others.

**Developers**: PocketPal AI is built using React Native. Finding an easy solution that balances text selection with preserved formatting (especially Markdown support) has been tricky for me. If you have experience in this area, I’d love to hear from you!
